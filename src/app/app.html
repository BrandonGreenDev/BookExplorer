<!--
  Root App Template

  Purpose: Provides router outlet for navigation between components

  How routing works:
  - Router displays SearchComponent at /search route
  - Router displays BookDetailComponent at /book/:id route
  - Each component has its own template and styling
  - Router-outlet is the placeholder where routed components appear
-->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
